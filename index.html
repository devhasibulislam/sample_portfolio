                    You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for
                    that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become
                    the Web Development Hero.

                    I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my
                    grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

                I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
                JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed
                it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
